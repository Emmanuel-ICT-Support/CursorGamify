# Future Ready — Careers & Employability Game

A browser-based scenario game for **Year 12 Careers and Employability (CEM) Unit 3 — Nature of Work** (Western Australia). Content is aligned to the unit materials: all scenarios, terminology, and consequences are derived from the CEM G12 U3 unit content (megatrends, work environments, types of employment, emerging and declining jobs, employability skills).

## How to run

- **Option 1:** Double-click `index.html` or open it in a browser (Chrome, Edge, Safari, Firefox).
- **Option 2:** From this folder, run a local server, e.g.  
  `npx serve .`  
  then open the URL shown (e.g. http://localhost:3000).

## Contents (from unit)

- **Four megatrends:** Impactful technology, Climate change, Demographic shifts, Economic power shifts  
- **Six employability skills:** Communication, Teamwork, Problem-solving, Digital literacy, Enterprising behaviours, Critical thinking  
- **Flow:** For each megatrend, students first complete a **quiz** (multiple choice + short answer) using the same **command verbs** as formal assessment (**Explain**, **Describe** — see Year 12 CAE Assessment Skills). Questions cover: explaining the megatrend in their own words (keywords), impact on work environments, types of employment, emerging and declining jobs, and impact on employability skills in both small and large organisations. After passing the quiz (80% multiple choice + completed short answer), they **unlock the scenario** for that megatrend.  
- **5 scenarios** drawn from the unit (small/large organisation examples). Each scenario has 3 choices and feedback that references the unit.
