# What I need from you (Front Seat build)

We’re doing the integration in phases. Below: **must-have** vs **nice-to-have**. I can use placeholders for anything you don’t have yet.

---

## Phase 1: Remove quiz gate + add Intel Feed (starting now)

**I’ll do with placeholders (no input needed from you):**
- Remove the “prove understanding to unlock” quiz before each scenario.
- Add a simple **Intel Feed** screen before each megatrend scenario (e.g. 4–6 items: “Message”, “Email”, “Headline”, “Staff comment” — I’ll write placeholder text per megatrend so you can replace later).
- Flow: Welcome/onboarding → (for each megatrend) **Intel Feed** → **Scenario (decision)** → **Feedback** → next megatrend or summary.
- Keep: org choice (small/large), one scenario per megatrend, skills, save, report.

**Optional from you (if you have it now):**
- **Intel content** for one megatrend (e.g. Impactful technology): 4–6 short items (message, email, headline, meeting snippet). Format: plain text or a list. I can copy-paste into the game. If not, I use placeholders.

---

## Phase 2: HQ Hub (after Phase 1 works)

**I’ll do:**
- New **HQ / Hub** screen after onboarding: 4 mission tiles (megatrends), player dashboard (skill bars, org context).
- After each episode you return to Hub and pick the next mission (or we keep linear order: Mission 1 → 2 → 3 → 4).
- No new content from you needed; I’ll reuse existing labels and skills.

**Optional from you:**
- Any specific wording for the Hub (e.g. “Mission board”, “Select a disruption”, “Your dashboard”).
- If you want missions to be **optional order** (pick any of 4) vs **linear** (must do 1 then 2 then 3 then 4). Default: linear for now.

---

## Phase 3: Second decision + risk + evidence

**I’ll do:**
- Two decision points per episode: Decision 1 → Consequence 1 → Decision 2 → Consequence 2.
- Add **risk meter** (0–100, promotion / stable / at risk) and **evidence tokens** (inventory in Hub).
- I’ll need **one extra choice set per megatrend** (Decision 2). I can duplicate the existing scenario and tweak the text to “ripple effect” so you have a template; you can then replace with real content.

**From you (when we get here):**
- For each megatrend: **Decision 2** scenario text + 3–4 choices + consequences (or permission to keep my “ripple effect” placeholder and you edit later in the code/content file).

---

## Phase 4: Debrief + Script Mode

**I’ll do:**
- After Consequence 2: **Debrief** (3 panels: work environments, types of employment, emerging/declining jobs) — I’ll use unit-aligned placeholder text per megatrend.
- **Manager Brief / Script Mode**: 1× Explain prompt, 1× Describe prompt per episode; save answers; simple feedback (e.g. “Did you include cause? Effect?”).
- I’ll reuse the *content* of your current quiz questions as the Explain/Describe prompts where it fits.

**From you (optional):**
- Exact wording for Explain/Describe prompts per megatrend if different from current quiz.
- Mark scheme or rubric (e.g. “Explain = 3 sentences: answer, cause, effect”) so I can code the feedback. If not, I’ll use a simple checklist.

---

## Phase 5: Skill-gated choices

**I’ll do:**
- Add skill thresholds (e.g. comm ≥ 40 unlocks “mediate meeting”); hide or grey out choices the player doesn’t qualify for.
- I’ll pick 1–2 choices per episode to gate as examples; you can add more later.

**From you:** Nothing required. Optional: list of “advanced” choices and which skill + threshold.

---

## Phase 6: EST Boss Mode + report extensions

**I’ll do:**
- Boss unlock screen when all 4 episodes complete.
- **EST Boss Mode**: lobby (Practice / Standard / Exam), question set (Explain/Describe), submit, auto-feedback, save attempts.
- Report: add timeline, evidence summary, “exam-ready answers” section.

**From you (when we get here):**
- **EST question set**: e.g. Q1 Explain (3 marks), Q2 Describe (4–6 marks), etc. — and ideally the “script” or mark scheme (what counts as cause/effect, how many features for Describe). If you have a doc or PDF, you can paste the relevant bits or upload.
- Any specific wording for “Boss” (e.g. “EST Simulation”, “Exam practice”, “Final assessment”).

---

## Summary: what I need from you *right now*

**Nothing required to start.** I’ll begin Phase 1 with:
- Quiz gate removed
- Placeholder Intel Feed (4–6 items per megatrend)
- Flow: Welcome → Intel → Scenario → Feedback → (repeat for 4 megatrends) → Summary → Report

If you have **real intel content** for one megatrend (Impactful technology or any other), paste it here or in a file and I’ll use it. Otherwise I’ll use placeholders and you can replace later.

**As we go:** I’ll tell you when we’re about to need Phase 3 content (second decision) or Phase 6 (EST script). You can upload or paste when ready.

---

## One decision from you now (optional)

- **Linear or open order for the 4 megatrends?**  
  - **Linear:** Must do Tech → Climate → Demographics → Economic (current behaviour).  
  - **Open:** From Hub, player can pick any of the 4 (any order).  
  I’ll assume **linear** unless you say “open”.

Once you confirm (or say “go with defaults”), I’ll start Phase 1.
